Extract the Wikipedia and Kaggle data from their respective files.


Britta is excited to prepare for the hackathon where we gather data from both Wikipedia and Kaggle, combine them, and save them into a SQL database so that the hackathon participants have a nice, clean dataset to use.

Raw data exists in multiple places and needs to be cleaned and structured before it can be analyzed. ETL breaks this problem into three steps, or phases: Extract, Transform, and Load.


We had to play with two types of data that we are merging; one set comes in a json format that was srcapped from wikipedia and two csv files from Kaggle on movie reviews.


 You're going to follow an iterative process based on three key steps: plan, inspect, execute.
